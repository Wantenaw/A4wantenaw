Hello there,
I would like to apologize for sending my assignment 4 as a zip file.
I have to submit my files this way I cannot get a build with no warnings, although my program works as
required. I have spent a few hours with this problem but I cannot seem to get a build that I can host on
dev.fast.sheridan.
I'm sorry for any inconvenience I may have caused,
Willem Wantenaar
